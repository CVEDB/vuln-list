  ],
  "Description": "[The HID Profile in multiple Bluetooth host stacks may accept connections with the HID control and HID interrupt channels of the HID Host role without MITM protection/mitigation and without user confirmation on the Central role device. This can permit a device like a keyboard (or emulating a keyboard) to successfully connect to a discoverable device without confirmation and permit keystroke injection.]",
  "UbuntuDescription": "It was discovered that BlueZ did not properly restrict non-bonded devices from injecting HID events into the input subsystem. This could allow a physically proximate attacker to inject keystrokes and execute arbitrary commands whilst the device is discoverable.",
  "Notes": [
    "eslerm| underlying issue was addressed in CVE-2020-0556, but was not enabled and not compliant with Security Mode 4",
